# DLS - Duckworth-Lewis-Stern

## Background

India: 300/8 (50 Overs) <br>
Then it rained, so game was reduced by 30 overs

If 300 runs in 50 overs <br>
Then **?** runs in 20 overs

runs = 300 x x20 / 500 = 120 <br>
New Target for Australia is 121 in 20 overs.

<font color="red">But this is not fair to Team India or for that matter the team that plays first.</font>

Why? --> Because, it is easy to make 121 runs in 20 overs than to make 301 runs in 50 overs. 

Why? --> Lesser the number of overs, the team plays more aggressively as they do not have to conserve all the 10 wickets for full 50 overs. Teams can achieve higher run rate in less overs as they do not have to worry about the wickets.

Duckworth-Lewis system was invented in order to make the game equally difficult for both the teams.

Today we know it as Frank <font color="blue">Duckworth</font> - Tony <font color="red">Lewis</font> - Steven <font color="green">Stern</font> method.

## Concept of Resources -- D-L (Duckworth/Lewis) method of adjusting target scores in interrupted one-day cricket matches - Standard Edition

    Wickets left: 10 
    Overs left: 50 
    % of Resources: 100% 

    Wickets left: 9 
    Overs left: 42 
    % of Resources: 86.3% 

    Wickets left: 6 
    Overs left: 29 
    % of Resources: 53.4% 

    Wickets left: 10 
    Overs left: 20 
    % of Resources: 56.6%

### Problem #1
So, going back to our problem:

If 300 runs in 50 overs <br>
Then **?** runs in 20 overs [match reduced by 30 overs]

| Runs | Resources  |
| -- | --|
| 300  | 100% |
| ?  | 56.6% |

runs = (300 x 56.6) / 100 = 169.8

Par Score = 169 <br>
Runs required to win = 170

---

### Problem #2
England score 101/2 (20 overs). Rain stopped play and reduced 30 overs from both sides. Revised target for New Zealand in 20 overs?

England started off with 50 overs in sight. But later 30 overs were reduced due to delay incurred because of the rain. 

Before the rain, England had 30 overs and 8 wickets to play with. --> which is 67.3% of resources to play with. [according to the DLS table on ICC website.]

So, England had utilised only 100% - 67.3% = 32.7% 

| Runs | Resources  |
| -- | --|
| 101  | 32.7% |
| ?  | 56.6% |

New Zealand has 20 overs and 10 wickets to play with. That corresponds to 56.6% resources.

runs = (101 x 56.6) / 32.7 = 174.8195 ~= 174

Par Score = 174 <br>
Runs required to win = 175

---

### Problem #3

SL: 306 (49 overs) <br> 
SA: 255/5 (44.2 overs)  <br>

Rain stopped play and game was called off. Who won the match?

SL have used up all resources because they lost all wickets before they could finish their 50 over quota.

SA had played 44.2 overs at a loss of 5 wickets. They have 5 wickets and 5.4 overs in hand. This means they have 17% resources to play with. So, they have used up 83% resources already.

| Runs | Resources  |
| -- | --|
| 306  | 100% |
| ?  | 83% |

runs = (306 x 83) / 100 = 253.98

Par Score = 253
Runs required to win = 254

Since SA have scored 255 already in 44.2 overs. SA **won** by 2 runs.

### Problem #4

WI: 118/2 (21 overs) <br>
Rain stopped play. 
WI at this stage had 29 overs and 8 wickets in hand, which means they had 70.3% resources left. **They used 29.7% resources**

It was then decided that both innings were reduced by 10 overs. <br>

So, now match is out of 40 overs for each side.

WI at this stage had to play with 8 wickets and 19 overs to play with, which means they had 50.5% resources left.

WI: 201/7 (35.3 overs) <br>
It rained again, so innings had to be suspended. <br>

So, WI scored 201 at a loss of 7 wickets in 35.3 overs. They had 4.3 overs and 3 wickets to play with. So they had 11.6% left to play with.

The total resources used were: 29.7% + (50.5% - 11.6%) = 29.7 + 38.9 = 68.6%

BAN innings was reduced to 25 overs. What should be their target? <br>


BAN has 25 overs and 10 wickets to play with. So they have 

| Runs | Resources  |
| -- | --|
| 201  | 68.6% |
| ?  | 66.5% |

runs = (201 * 66.5) / 68.6 = 194.84

Par Score = 194 <br>
Runs required to win = 195
